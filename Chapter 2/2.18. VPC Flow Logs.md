# 2.18. VPC Flow Logs

Flows Logs capture traffic going in and out of the VPC.

VPC Flow Logs may be defined for:

- VPCs
- Subnets
- ENIs

The Flow Logs can be sent to either a CloudWatch Log Group or an S3 bucket.

Data reporting is not real time. **Data logged every one minute or ten minutes**.

#### Facts About Flow Logs

- Does not capture all IP traffic from:
  - EC2 DNS requests to Route 53. Requests to your own DNS servers are logged.
- Amazon Windows license activation.
- Instance metadata.
- Amazon Time Sync Service.
- DHCP traffic.
- Default VPC router.
- Endpoint services.
- Application data because flow logs only operate at Layer 3 and 4 of the OSI model.
