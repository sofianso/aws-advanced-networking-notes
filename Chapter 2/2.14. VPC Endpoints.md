### Facts About VPC Endpoints

- Endpoints are region-scoped services.
- They cannot be accessed from outside a VPC or from another region.
- DNS resolution is required to redirect the internal VPC DNS to VPC endpoint.
- **By default**, VPC Endpoint will allow unrestricted access to S3 or DynamoDB. However, you can restrict the access using S3/DynamoDB policy).
- Using SGs is preferred because you can reference networking objects (e.g. VPC endpoint).
- You can have multiple VPC endpoints within the same VPC - even for the same service. Each policy can have its own policy and each can be applied to different subnets. -
  **- Remember that when configuring VPC Endpoint, you must have a policy for both VPC Endpoint and AWS resource that allow you to access the AWS resource.**
