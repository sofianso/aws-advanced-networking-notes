# 2.6. Subnets, VPC Routers, and Route Tables Part 2

![Ideal Routing Tables in a VPC](./../assets/ideal_routing_tables.png?raw=true)

The **Five Addresses Reserved by AWS** are defined in the following (using the example from above):

- 10.0.64.0: Network address.
- 10.0.64.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
- 10.0.64.2: The IP address of the DNS server.
- 10.0.64.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
- 10.0.71.255: Network broadcast address.

Ideally you want to create a route table for each subnet because it will allow fine-grained control over the routing of traffic.
