#### Cluster Performance Group

- It is recommended that you use the same instance type for Cluster Placement Group because if you use a difference instance type that instance might not be available in that AZ.
- Instances within a cluster placement group can use up to 10 Gbps per single-flow traffic.
- Network traffic to the internet and over an AWS Direct Connect connection to on-premises resources is limited 5 Gbps.

#### Maximum Tranmission Unit (MTU)

- MTU is the largest permissible packet that can be passed over the connection.
- Ethernet Frames is Ethernet v2 frame format. it supports 1500 MTU, which is the largest packer size over most of the internet.
- Jumbo frames support 9001 MTU, however, this can only be supported if the packets travel through the same VPC or multiple VPCs via VPC Peering.

#### Enhanced Networking

The allowed size for a secondary IPv4 CIDR block is between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask. Add IPv4 CIDR blocks to a VPC.
