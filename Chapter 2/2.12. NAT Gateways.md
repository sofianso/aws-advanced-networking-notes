# 2.12. NAT Gateways

### Facts About NAT Gateway

- Managed by AWS
- Scales up to 45 Gbps per second.
- The cost depends on the amount of data that is sent through the NAT gateway.
- Cannot associate SGs with a NAT gateway, but can associate SGs with resources behind the NAT gateway.

### Facts About NAT Instance

- Managed by customer.
- Use scripts to check the health of the NAT instance.
- Depends on the bandwidth of the instance type.
- The cost depends on the instance type and size.
- Associate SGs both on your NAT instance and the resources behind it.

**Why creating a NAT Instance is not the solution:**

- When the traffic or instances from the private subnets increase over time, the NAT instance might not be able to handle the traffic. This can be handled by upgrading the instance type, however, this will lead to downtime.
- In general, you want to have NAT instances in different AZs. However, there might come a time in which both AZs might go down. Usually, developers create a script that checks the "heartbeat" of the instances. Again, this is why creating a NAT instance is not preferred.

**Why creating a NAT Gateway is the solution:**

- NAT Gateway is elastic meaning it will automatically adjust to the increase or decrease of traffic.
- It can handle traffic up to 45 Gbps per second.
