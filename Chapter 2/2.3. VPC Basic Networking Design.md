# 2.3. VPC Basic Networking Design

### IPv4 vs IPv6 range

If you decide to use and configure IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC (or Dual Stack Mode), the configurations of IPv4 and IPv6 will be independent of each other.

#### IPv4 Addressing

- Required for all VPCs configuration.
- CIDR block between a size of /16 to /28 CIDR block.
- You choose the private CIDR block.
- You can configure public and private addresses.

#### IPv6 Addressing

- Optional in your VPC configuration.
- Has a fixed size of /56 CIDR block.
- AWS automatically assigns the CIDR block. You have no control to select a range.
- There in difference between public and private addresses. Security is controlled with routing and security policies.

#### Subnets

A subnet lives inside one availability zone. In one region, you might have 3 subnets because there are 3 availability zones in the region. In addition, a subnet cannot span more than one availability zone.
