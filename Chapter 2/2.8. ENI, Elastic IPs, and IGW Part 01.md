# 2.8. ENI, Elastic IPs, and IGW Part 01

## Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

An ENI is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in a VPC.

An ENI consists of the following attributes:

1. MAC address.
2. Internal IP addresses.
3. Auto-assigned external IP.
4. Elastic external IP.
5. Source/destination checks.
6. Security groups, can have up to more 5 SGs. Request more from AWS if needed.
7. An ENI is assigned to that availability zone.

You cannot expect to add more ENIs to an instance to improve performance.
