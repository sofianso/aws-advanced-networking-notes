# 2.16 VPC Peering

### VPN Endpoint Limitations

- You will need multiple EC2 instances for high availability which will incur more costs.
- Personnel costs to maintain the VPC endpoints.
- Performance issues even with large EC2 instances.
- SGs are limited to the IP ranges from the remote end of the software VPN endpoint.

### VPC Peering

Both VPCs must be enabled for DNS hostnames and DNS resolution.

To enable a VPC to resolve public IPv4 DNS hostnames to private IPv4 addresses when queried from instances in the peer VPC, both VPCs must be enabled for DNS hostnames and DNS resolution.

To make sure the two VPCs are able to communicate with each other we must first make sure the appropriate routes have been setup in each of the route tables for both VPCs.

The enableDnsHostnames and the enableDnsSupport setting must be enable on both VPCs.
