3.8. Health Checks

Types of Health Checks:

- Endpoint - tests response from a single endpoint.
  - Checks every 10 or 30 seconds.
  - A check fails if there is no response within 4 seconds (HTTP/HTTPS) or 10 seconds (TCP).
  - If LESS than 18% of the checkers consider the endpoint healthy, Route 53 considers the endpoint unhealthy.
  - Create IP address health checks for endpoints using latency testing.
    **- Ideally, it's better to have the health check point at a simple HTML file rather a domain or IP address. This will reduce costs calling the API.**
- One parent-check to many child-checks.
- Parent-check is healthy if X child-checks are health.
- CloudWatch alarms.
