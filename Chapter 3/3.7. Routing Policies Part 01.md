# 3.7. Routing Policies Part 01

Routing policies determine how to respond to queries.

5 Type of Routing Policies:

- Simple - Plain and simple routing.
- Weighted - Percentage routing.
- Latency-based - Fastest connection routing.
- Failover - For Disaster Recovery purposes.
- Geolocation - Location-based routing.
  - Geolocation is not always accurate since some IP addresses have no geolocation data associated with them, and the ISP might decide to move IP block ranges. To improve accuracy, use the   extension.
- Multi-value response routing policy - Responds with multiple hosts.
